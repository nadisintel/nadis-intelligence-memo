## The Problem I Lived

In 2022, my AI startup crossed $1M ARR—and exposed a structural flaw in how modern companies operate.

We ran 47 tools. Spent $12K/month on overlapping systems. Lost 15 hours/week to friction.  
But it wasn’t just inefficiency. It was incoherence. We did not have the infrastrcuture needed to scale our operations to meet demand. We had enterprise contracts we could not fill and in 2024, we closed operations. 

> **Organizations today have minds everywhere—but no shared intelligence.**  
> Teams act in isolation. Tools multiply. Strategy fragments.

## What We're Building

We’re creating **the intelligence layer for adaptive organizations**—systems that transform scattered signals into coordinated action.

### LIVE: SCALE Factor™  
A 5-minute diagnostic for operational intelligence  
→ Measures alignment, efficiency, and infrastructure potential

### Coming in Q4 2025: Symbi™  
A living infrastructure layer  
→ Real-time visibility across people, tools, and decisions  
→ Pattern detection and predictive signals  
→ Alignment insights before friction occurs

### Coming in 2026: ALICE™  
Computing that adapts to how humans think  
→ Ambient, intent-responsive interfaces  
→ Coordinated systems that evolve as you do  
→ Designed to make software disappear into intelligence
→ The end of app-switching and tool management

## What the Market Tells Us

From 60+ conversations with founders, Heads of Ops, and CTOs:

> "We have a $3M/year brain trust making decisions through a $50 Slack account. The infrastructure gap is killing our competitive advantage." 
> — CTO, Series B FinTech
> "We measure everything but understand nothing. It's like having perfect vision in 47 different directions—you still can't see where you're going."
> — Head of Ops, 15-person start-up


From SCALE Factor diagnostics:
- Avg. operational coherence: **38%**  
- Avg. waste identified: **$32K/month**  
- **73%** of orgs lack foundational AI infrastructure

## Why Now

**The shift is underway.**  
AI made computing adaptive. But most companies are still scaling like it’s 2015.

What’s changing:
- AI tooling has outpaced infrastructure design  
- Remote work decoupled context from coordination  
- Complexity now exceeds human-scale leadership

What’s emerging:
- Infrastructure AS intelligence, not just for intelligence 
- Demand for coherence, not just capability  
- Readiness for ambient, evolving systems

This isn’t about adopting more tools.  
It’s about rearchitecting how organizations think.

## Why Me

- **Technical Depth**: DARPA AI finalist, National Science Foundation Grant Winner, Google, AWS, NLP researcher  
- **Operator Reality**: Scaled previous startups from 0 to $1M+ ARR  
- **Pattern Recognition**: Synthesized 60+ exec interviews into product signals  
- **Ecosystem Buildout**: Revenue and traction through SCALE Factor Accelerator

This isn’t a theory. It’s the next layer of systems thinking—grounded in experience.
